Customize the admin area of a WP install. It also styles the login screen. 
Allows you to change the admin area as easily as changing your normal theme.

== Description ==

Change how Wordpress' admin area looks by adding your own images/CSS to
replace the defaults. This includes customizing the login screen.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin in Wordpress.

2. Create a folder in the theme directory called admin to hold the other files
  If you have a multisite install, you can also use admin-{NETWORK ID}

3. Add your own custom CSS to a file called admin-styles.css

4. To use custom JS, add a file called admin-scripts.js. This will be loaded
  after other scripts in the admin area.

5. Images go in a folder called images. You can reference this in the theme
  as images/*

6. Done! The admin area will now use your custom theme.
